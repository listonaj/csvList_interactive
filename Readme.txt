 Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with a CSV file. 
 Here's a summary of how the code works:

Import necessary modules: 
The program starts by importing the required modules, including tkinter for the GUI components, messagebox for displaying messages, and simpledialog for collecting user input.

Define the append_data function: 
This function allows users to enter data and appends it to a CSV file. Users are prompted to enter values for "name," "age," "street_number," "street_name," "city," "state," "zip_code," and "phone_number." The data is formatted as a comma-separated line and written to the CSV file. Users can continue adding data, and the function handles each entry with a loop.

Define the create_new_list function: This function creates a new CSV file with a header containing the column names "name," "age," "streetNumber," "streetName," "city," "state," "zipCode," and "phoneNumber." Users are prompted to fill the new list with data using the append_data function if they choose to do so.

Define the main function: The main function creates the main GUI window using tkinter. It sets the window's title to "CSV Creator Menu" and creates two buttons: one for creating a new list and another for appending elements to an existing list. These buttons are linked to the create_new_list and append_data functions, respectively. The GUI is displayed in the mainloop().

Run the program: Finally, the program runs the main function if the script is executed as the main program.

This code provides a basic interactive menu for creating and managing CSV data, allowing users to create new lists and add elements to existing lists through a simple GUI.
